        <p>We are a compassionate group of volunteers dedicated to rescue as many horses as possible from slaughter, neglect, and abuse and to find permanent loving homes for them when possible or to retire here where they are loved and safe.</p>

    <p>When you donate, every penny goes to the horses for feed, hay, medical care and other necessities.  There will be no tomorrow for many unwanted horses, however with your help we can save many that otherwise would perish.</p>
    <p>We are a group of horse lovers, determined to make a difference for as many horses as possible. Sometimes the task seems insurmountable but we are inspired and exhilarated when we touch, hear, and see the horses that contentedly munch in their safe environment.</p>
